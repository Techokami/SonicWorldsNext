## This tool provides functions that are useful for testing gimmicks for things
## like how the player reacts while attached to them them when they get hit by
## something or how they react when something pushes them off of it or if they
## touch the ground while on it. To use it, simply add the node to your scene
## (preferably somewhere out of the way) and use the keys that it checks to
## have certain effects.
##
## k - hurts the first player
## j - hurts the second player
## l - sets a return position for use with ;
## ; - teleports one or both players to the return position set with l
## u - places the big brick underneath the player and has it slowly move upwards
## i - places the big brick above the player and has it slowly move downwards
## o - places the big brick to the left of the player and has it slowly move
##     right
## p - places the big brick to the right of the player and has it slowly move
##     left
## m - Gives the player some rings
## , - Cycles through available shields
