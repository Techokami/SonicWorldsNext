# Tool for complex moving objects with multiple states
# Use this node as the parent for another node that you want to move around
# And in addition to the node that you want to move around, create StateMover.gd
# extended classes (StateMoverPositional.gd and StateMoverTranslational.gd included
# as children of the StateMoverMaster. The order of the statemover objects determines
# what their 'state' value is and each statemover can reference other state movers in the tree by
# that number.
#
# example structure:
#
# StateMoverMaster (node2D)
# |_ MyFancyPlatform (possibly just the existing Platform.gd)
# |_ StateMover_01 (node2D with script 'StateMoverPositional' attached
# |_ StateMover_02 (node2D with script 'StateMoverTranslational' attached
# |_ StateMover_03 (node2D with script 'StateMoverPositional' attached

# The first state will have MyFancyPlatform drift over to the location of StateMover_02.
# The second state will then have the platform be moved to a position picked based
# on a vector provided to StateMoverTranslational via exported variable
# The final state will move the platform to the position of StateMover_03
