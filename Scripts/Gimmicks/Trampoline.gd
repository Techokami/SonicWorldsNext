# Edit the inherited values to change cosmetic features of the connective rings
# The trampoline inherits the following exported values from AnimatedTextureDrawer
#spriteTexture - Picks the texture used to draw the rings - the spriteTexture should contain frames aligned in a horizontal fashion
#spriteFrameCount - Set this to the number of frames in the sprite Texture2D
#animationMode - if set to pingpong, the animation will play from beginning to end, then end to beginning before looping.
#              - if set to loop, the animation will play from beginning to end and then loop from the beginning
#timePerFrame - how many seconds the animation frame should be played before moving on to the next one. Lower means faster.

# Edit these values to control cosmetic elements about the sprites that get drawn on the side of the trampoline
@export var ringsPerSide = 3 # How many rings to draw on each side of the platform - set to two or less to just get rid of them.
@export var ringsMargin = 30 # Pixels away from the center of the platform to start drawing rings
@export var ringsBetween = 12 # Pixels between each ring drawn

# How the connective rings are positioned
# linear - the rings are placed in a line. Plain, but true to the form of the original. Works best with spaced out rings.
# center_parabolice - the center platform is the apex/trough of the parabola of rings for that classy look
# edge_parabolic - XXX Coming eventually maybe.
