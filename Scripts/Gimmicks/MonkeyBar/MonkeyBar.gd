## Brachiatable Hanger Bars (IE Monkeybars)

## Just like with hanging bar, if this is set to false then the player can
## conect to the central hanger while jumping upwards instead instead of 
## only when falling
@export var only_active_moving_down = true

## Lets a player drop through the hanger without getting caught if they are holding down
## Note that the official games handled this a bit differently. Holding *any* direction while
## jumping off of a holdable bar type gimmick would result in all other holdable bar type gimmicks
## being unconnectable in Sonic 2/3K. That's not very intuitive though and leads to some strange
## interactions.
@export var hold_down_to_drop = false

## Adjusts the brachiate animation speed. This means bar to bar transitions will be faster. Note
## that the item you are brachiating to determines the speed, not the item you are brachiating from.
## 1.0 is the base. 2.0 is twice as fast. 0.5 is half as fast.
@export var brachiate_speed = 1.0

## When jumping off while holding a direction, the player will be imparted with
##   some immediate speed

## If true, player will not be able to brachiate off of this bar
@export var depart_locked = false

## If true, player will not be able to brachiate on to this bar

## TODO NOT IMPLEMENTED - blocked by some necessary collision changes around
## hang animation

# Note: If you ever wanted to get *really* crazy with this, you could give
# every player character a weight and have a weight mounted value instead. Not
# exactly the most Sonicy thing in the world (Chaotix exampted), but could be
# fun for a puzzle game like Lost Vikings.

# FUNCTIONS INTENDED FOR USE BY DESIGNERS BELOW

# The most obvious use for set_lock_depart and set_lock_impart is to prevent
# the player from brachiating to a given monkeybar when that monkeybar is being
# moved by something or is just moving quick enough that you think transfering
# to this monkeybar will look awkward. In the provided example, Retractible Chain
# will lock impart and depart while the chain is moving and unlock them when the
# chain stops, all using signals for maximum flexibility.

## Using this function with a value of true makes it so that players on this
## Monkey Bar can't brachiate to another monkeybar and have to jump off instead.
