# Array of Arrays for each player interacting with the gimmick...
# Please don't access/mutate this array directly, use the relevant functions
# or add new ones where needed.
#
# [n][0] - player's object id
#
# [n][1] - player's phase - This is their current angle spinning around the top of the barrel
#
# [n][2] - player's radius - The radius of their spinning - if they jump on the barrel closer to the
#          edge, their radius will be larger. If they jump on the barrel dead center, their radius
#          will be zero.
#
# [n][3] - player's z level - the z level index that the player originally entered the gimmick on.
#          Needs to be restored after disconnecting from the gimmick. While on the gimmick, the
#          player's z level index will be shifted every frame according to their radius and phase.
